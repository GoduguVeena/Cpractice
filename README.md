# C Practice Repository

Welcome to the **cpractice** repository! 🚀

This repository contains C programming problems that I have been practicing as part of my **10-day C training**. It serves as a collection of solved problems, concepts, and coding exercises to strengthen my understanding of the C language.

## 📚 Topics Covered
Throughout the training, I have worked on:
- ✅ Basic Input/Output
- ✅ Variables and Data Types
- ✅ Operators and Expressions
- ✅ Conditional Statements (if-else, switch-case)
- ✅ Loops (for, while, do-while)
- ✅ Functions and Recursion


## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add more complex problem statements and solutions.
- Optimize and document code with proper explanations.
- Implement coding challenges and mini-projects in C.

## 🤝 Contributions
This repository is mainly for personal learning, but if you find any errors or have suggestions, feel free to create an issue or pull request. 😊
